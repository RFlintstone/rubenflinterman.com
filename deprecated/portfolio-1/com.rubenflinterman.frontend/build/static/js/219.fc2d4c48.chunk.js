The project focused on two innovative concepts aimed at improving patient care and reducing the workload of healthcare professionals. The Pati\xebnt-ID system was conceptualized to simplify the management and sharing of medical data, making it easily accessible to both patients and healthcare providers without the burden of complex login procedures or unnecessary administration. The concept aligns with existing standards such as MedMij and GDPR. For the Expert-By-Experience platform, we conducted extensive research and developed a minimum viable product (MVP). This platform provides a secure environment for patients to share experiences and access verified information from trusted sources such as Erasmus UMC and the WHO. On June 18th, we presented both our findings and the MVP to a large public audience.
