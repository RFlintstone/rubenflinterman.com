[www.rubenflinterman.com](http://www.rubenflinterman.com/) serves as a portfolio which shows my experience. Since this is effectively the landing page of the website it includes a navigation which direct you to publicly available pages.

The idea is for the portfolio to be fully dynamic, loading content directly from my personal database. This is handled through a [**secured api**](/#/4-api-rubenflinterman.com) accessible only with a valid access token and bearer token.
